## ES6-jQuery Webpack Boilerplate

My personal ES6-jQuery boilerplate built with Babel 6 & Webpack 4.

# Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

# Folder structure

Below is the folder structure.

```
src
└── css
│    │
│    └── all.css
└── index.js
public
├── assets
└── index.html
```

Add styles to the `css` folder or for mutiple css files use `@import` to the `styles.css` to add those files.

Add images to the `assets` folder.

The main JS file can be found in the `src/index.js`, libraries are also imported there.

Update the `index.html` in the public directory to suite your needs.

Change the `favicon.ico` with any icon.
